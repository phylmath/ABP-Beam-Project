# Beam physics for colliders
This repository tracks my learning of software frameworks used in accelerator physics research at CERN, namely:
- [XSuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in Python for particle beam dynamics simulations.
- [MAD-X]() or 'Methodical Accelerator Design' in C/C++ for beam optics and lattice studies
