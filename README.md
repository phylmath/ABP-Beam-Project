# Accelerator design
This repository tracks the my learning progress of software frameworks used in accelerator physics research at CERN, namely:
- [XSuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for particle beam dynamics simulations. It is written mainly in Python.
- [MAD-X]() or 'Methodical Accelerator Design' for beam optics and lattice studies. It is written in C/C++/Fortran77/Fortran90.


HEP Phenomenology project studying hadronic jet physics in the CERN-FCCee. The analyses are coded in C++ using the Pythia 8.312, ROOT 6.32.08, and FastJet 3.4.3 frameworks.
