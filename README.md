# Beam physics for colliders
This repository tracks my learning of software frameworks used in accelerator physics research at CERN, namely:
- [XSuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for simulating particle beam dynamics.
- [MAD-X](https://madx.web.cern.ch/) for studying beam optics and lattice formulations.
